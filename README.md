# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for myself and other boot camp students who are going through the Boot Camp Prework. I will use this website going forward as a tool and as a reminder as to everything that was learned while creating this webpage during Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, and these notes are organized accordingly. At times this webpage seemed impossible to build, as I've never done this before, but I have learned throughout this process that I am capable of building webpages, and my attention to detail persevered.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. The different sections of notes are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) or right-click anywhere on the browser window, and select "Inspect" from the menu, then click on the console tab. A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
